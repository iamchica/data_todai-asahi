宿題１について北村先生からのコメント

要するに私の場合、

2003年のYes/No設問について、非該当の回答が9のままになっていた
他の年に揃えるためには99に置き換える必要がある

2005年の性別など尋ねる設問は、文字情報で入っているので数値に置き換える必要がある

【反省】記述統計を表示して確認してみるべきでした

選挙結果の数値が他の年と同じ定義で作れているかを確認する


Dear all:

Here comes some comments regarding your assignment.

1. The assignment was graded according to the following points.

(1) Whether the code produces an output.
(2) 2003:  Whether you change 9 to 99 in all relevant "yn_" variables.
(3) 2005: 
     (i) Whether you adjust values for variables such as sex, prefecture, age, and all relevant "yn_" variables.
     (ii) Whether the code creates a new "name" variable by combining the family name and the first name.
(4) 2012 & 2014: Whether you change RESULT variable so that it corresponds to the other years.
(5) 2009, 2012 & 2014: Whether the code removes "=" from candidate names so that they will be consistent across years.
(6) Whether the code adjusts party names so that they will be consistent across years.

All of your code can produce an output, and many recognize the point (3) (ii), but there are differences across assignments regarding the rest of the points. I recommend you to check the final data to check if all variables are correctly made. I also admit that my previous code didn't deal with some of the points above but some of you correctly modified them (thanks!).

2.  For those who write "path_to_your_folder/input/xxxx.csv" to import data, please use either (a) "os.chdir("..")" and just "input/xxxx.csv" as I do in my classroom example, or (b) "os.chdir("path_to_your_folder")" and "input/xxxx.csv", instead of writing the entire path to each of your csv files. The reason is quite simple---It is hardly replicated in another computer because one has to change the paths one-by-one.

3. Recall that Python (and others programs like R) is case sensitive. Be careful when using capital letters and small letters. Also, be careful when you replace a value using "replace()". It could be a string or a number (e.g., replace({'9':'99'}) is correct, not replace({9:99})).

I attach my code for comparison below.

Have a nice weekend!

Best,
Shuhei
